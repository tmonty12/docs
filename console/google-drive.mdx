We recommend connecting Google Drive if you're lookignt to copy/save Jupyter Notebooks, datasets or model checkpoints.

The only other option for moving files is uploading and downloading using the Lab inteface. If you are using files over 10 MB, we recommend using Google Drive as it has better performance.

## Connecting

You first need to [connect your Drive](../connect-google-drive) in order to use it with a Lab.

## Automatic Copies

When you have enabled Google Drive connection on your Lab, all files from the folder you selected will be copied over when the Lab is first created.

Likewise, when you close your Lab, all new files on your Lab will be copied to your Google Drive folder.

## Copy to Lab

At any point in time, you can copy new files from your Google Drive to your Lab.

Say you wanted to test fine-tuning on a new dataset you have locally. You can upload the dataset to your Google Drive folder and then click the ```Copy to Lab``` button.

## Copy to Drive

Likewise, at any point in time you can copy files from your Lab to your Google Drive.

If you had a model checkpoint that was generated that you would like to test locally, you can click the ```Copy to Drive``` button and it will appear in your Drive folder.

## Selecting Folders

In the Google Drive Connection page you can select a default folder. In the Launch Lab page, you can override this default. 

This folder is where files are copied from and where files are copied too.

<Note>Only files in a sub directory of the Lab are copied to your Google Drive</Note>

## Disconnecting

You have the option to disconnect your Google Drive. This deletes the Google Auth token from our backend. 

To connect again, you follow the same flow.
