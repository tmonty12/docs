## What are Credits?

Credits are how Lab instances are paid for on the Agora platform.

1 credit = $1

<Note>Each user is given 3 free credits</Note>

If you run out credits, any running Lab will be shut down. You must purchase more credits in order to create a new Lab.

## How are Credits Used?

Lab's are priced in credits per hour. The rate is calculated by the GPU type and number of GPU(s) selected.

Each Lab will reflect the amount of credits you have used. This is deducted from your total credits.

## Buying Credits

In order to buy credits, click the ```Add Credits``` button.

Once there, select the number of credits you would like to buy.

<Warning>You must purchase a minimum of 5 credits</Warning>

Then make your payment. Your credit balance should be updated pretty immediately.
