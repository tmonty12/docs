## What is Agora Labs?

Agora Labs creates AI development environments backed by cheap, high-powered GPUs. In less than 5 minutes, you can go from selecting the base image, GPU type and number of GPUs to fine-tuning an LLM with a Jupyter Lab interface.

## Why Agora Labs?

When we went to finetune LLaMa2-7B we found that we were not able to find powerful enough GPUs for finetuning or would wind up spending hundreds of dollars doing so. Furthermore, renting a GPU required installing the necessary libraries and copying our data over. It took half an hour before we were even fine-tuning!

Our platform provides high-powered GPUs (including clusters) such as A100s, at the cheapest prices. Configure your dev environment and get to your task in less than 5 minutes.
