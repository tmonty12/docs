  <Step title="Connect Google Drive (Optional)">
    If you would like to have a folder from your Google Drive copied to your Jupyter Lab and save any newly created files to your Drive, you will first need to [connect your Drive](connect-google-drive).

    Once connected, toggle on the connection and select the folder you would like to copy from and save to.
