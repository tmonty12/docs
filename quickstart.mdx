  <Step title="Connect Google Drive (Optional)">
    If you would like to have a folder from your Google Drive copied to your development environment and save any newly created files to your Drive, you will first need to [connect your Drive](development).

    Once connected, toggle on the connection and select the folder you would like to copy/save from/to.
